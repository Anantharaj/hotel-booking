Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

git clone https://github.com/Anantharaj/hotel-booking.git
```

... or [downloading source code] code as a zip archive.

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

## Running locally in development mode

## Building and deploying in production

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

## NPM

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

## Yarn

    yarn
    yarn build
    yarn start

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. `PORT=3000 npm start`).
